You can import `getable`'s default Rmd template with in RStudio by selecting: `File > New File > R Markdown > From Template > HTML Tables with Dynamic Data {GETable}`

This will generate a folder.
You can then open the Rmd source file and edit the document. Note that the relative path of the dependency files (`*.html`, `*.js`, and `*.css`) to the source Rmd must stay constant for the package to work. 

See [demo](https://yongfu.name/getable/demo/) for a working example.
